To pick out a specific part of a webpage, like a section or box, we use something called getElementById in JavaScript. Every part of a webpage can have a name, called an ID, that makes it easy to find. Imagine you give a box on the page the name "targetDiv" in the code (for example, <div id="box">). JavaScript can then look for that exact name to find the box.
Once we find the box using getElementById, we save it in a variable. You can think of a variable like a storage box where we put the thing we found so we can easily use it later. Now that weâ€™ve saved the box in this "storage box" (the variable), we can start making changes to it, like changing its color, size, or other things that affect how it looks.
